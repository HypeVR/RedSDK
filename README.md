# RedSDK and RCPSDK repo

Warning:
	rpc_log function definition has been removed from SDK. It gives flexibility in the implementation of logging functionality using R.C.P API. But rcp_log is required to be a defined function for R.C.P API to operate normally. Please make sure to define the function in down stream implementatiopn.
